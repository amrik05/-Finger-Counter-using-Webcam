"# -Finger-Counter-using-Webcam" 
Finger Counter that utilizes a userâ€™s webcam or phone via Irium. This project utilizes a CNN that is trained off of different hand image data, and OpenCV processes that data and feeds the model input from the webcam. The model then predicts the number of fingers the user is holding up and displays it. Transfer learning was also conducted to see if a gradient boosting model (XGB) could process the image data more efficiently. This project is a work in progress; has fine tuning to do but is able to properly predict most cases of hands. Stuggles with different hand orientations.
